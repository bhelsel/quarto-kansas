  "Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit,
  with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to
  execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without
  modification. Extensions are a powerful way to modify and extend the behavior
  of Quarto." This text was copied verbatim from the Quarto website (quarto.org)
  to generate text for an abstract within the quarto-kansas extension.
