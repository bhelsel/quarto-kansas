# quarto-kansas: An Unofficial Quarto Theme Extension

This Quarto extension is currently under development.

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template bhelsel/quarto-kansas
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

Only the HTML format is usable now and it contains some basic css formatting with a header for the University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.
